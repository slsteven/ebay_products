# Ebay Query #

System to automate querying top performing Ebay products

Developed application with Node.js to query top performing items. This helps reduce the working time from five hours to a couple of seconds. Interface allows user to upload CSV document which gets converted to JSON. Application parses data crawled from Ebay web pages and Ebay API. Used Async to handle callbacks from multiple requests and Underscore library to filter and compare data. Result eliminates the need for the user to manually check hundreds of rows of internal data with online listings. On completion, user can export file with complete report or view data from visual tables.
